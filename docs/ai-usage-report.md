## Tools Used & Use Cases
- **lovable.dev**: Built the initial project as a Vite + TypeScript + React app with TailwindCSS and component libraries.  
- **ChatGPT**: Helped translate the React/Tailwind implementation into a **HTML/CSS/JS** version, and refined styles, structure, and documentation.

## Benefits & Challenges
**Benefits:**
- Accelerated development and design process.
- It did the best practices to transform from modern frameworks (Tailwind, React) to plain CSS/JS while adapting them.

**Challenges:**
- Framework-specific utilities (like Tailwind classes and React state handling) had to be carefully rewritten in **HTML/CSS/JS** equivalents.
